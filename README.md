# **Hello World**
My IGN's Zephkier, so that's a pretty unique way to identify me. If not, Benjamin's cool too.

Currently a student studying CS because I love sitting and typing.

No idea what I'm going to focus/pursue, but I _am_ rather interested in Web Development and something Security-related.

# **Bye World**
Add me on ðŸ‘¾[Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/id/zephkier/)ðŸ‘¾!

I just started working on getting 100% completions and achievements in all of my games, so there's that.
