# Hello World

My IGN's Zephkier, which is a unique way to identify me (I hope). If not, Benjamin's cool too.

Currently a student studying CS because I love sitting and typing.

# Bye World

Add me on ðŸ‘¾[Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/id/zephkier/)ðŸ‘¾!

I just started working on getting 100% completions and achievements in all of my games, so there's that.
