# Hello World

My IGN's Zephkier, which is a unique way to identify me (I hope). If not, Benjamin's cool too.

Currently a student under UoL BSc CS because I love sitting and typing.

# Bye World

I love to play games, specifically trying to get 100% completions and achievements, so there's that :)
